description: "Configure fallback and multi-deployment routing strategies for liter-llm."
title: "Fallback and Routing"
---

Liter-llm provides two composable Tower layers for multi-deployment scenarios: `FallbackLayer` for primary-plus-backup patterns, and `Router` for distributing load across a fleet of deployments with six selectable strategies.

## Fallback

`FallbackLayer` wraps a primary service with a single backup service. When the primary fails with a transient error, the same request is replayed on the fallback.

Non-transient errors (`Authentication`, `BadRequest`, `ContextWindowExceeded`, `ContentPolicy`, `NotFound`, `EndpointNotSupported`, `Serialization`, `InvalidHeader`, `HookRejected`) propagate immediately without consulting the fallback, because retrying them on a different endpoint produces the same result.

Transient errors that trigger the fallback: `RateLimited`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `Timeout`, `ServerError`, `Network`.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{FallbackLayer, LlmService};
use tower::{Layer, ServiceBuilder};

let primary = LlmService::new(openai_client);
let backup  = LlmService::new(anthropic_client);

let service = FallbackLayer::new(backup).layer(primary);
```

:::caution[Streaming buffer]
When `LlmService` is used inside the Tower stack, streaming responses (`ChatStream`) are fully buffered in memory before being yielded. This is required by Tower's `Service` trait, which mandates `'static` futures. All chunks are collected into a `VecDeque` and replayed. If unbuffered streaming is required, call `LlmClient::chat_stream()` directly, bypassing the Tower stack.
:::

## Router

`Router` distributes `LlmRequest`s across multiple service instances according to a `RoutingStrategy`. All deployments must be `Clone`.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{LlmService, Router, RoutingStrategy};

let deployments = vec![
    LlmService::new(client_us_east),
    LlmService::new(client_eu_west),
    LlmService::new(client_us_west),
];

let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::RoundRobin)?;
```

`Router::new` returns `LiterLlmError::BadRequest` if `deployments` is empty.

## Routing strategies

| Strategy         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RoundRobin`     | Cycles through deployments in order using an atomic counter.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Fallback`       | Tries deployments in order. Advances to the next on a transient error. Returns the last error when all deployments fail.                                                                                                                     |
| `LatencyBased`   | Routes to the deployment with the lowest observed latency using an exponential moving average (alpha = 0.3). Deployments with no data default to EMA 0.0 (treated as fastest).                                                               |
| `CostBased`      | Tries deployments in order, logging estimated USD cost per response. In the current implementation, routes identically to `Fallback` while cost telemetry is recorded. Per-deployment provider metadata for true cost comparison is planned. |
| `WeightedRandom` | Selects a deployment by weighted random distribution. Weights need not sum to 1.0; they are used as relative proportions.                                                                                                                    |
| `Semantic`       | Routes by intent: calls a [`RouteClassifier`](#semantic) cascade with the prompt text and the deployments' real model IDs, then dispatches to whichever deployment serves the returned model ID. Falls back to round-robin when the classifier defers or names a model with no matching deployment. |

### RoundRobin

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::RoundRobin)?;
```

Requests are distributed evenly in a cycle. All deployments receive traffic regardless of health.

### Fallback

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::Fallback)?;
```

Tries each deployment in order. Only transient errors (same set as `FallbackLayer`) advance to the next. Non-transient errors short-circuit immediately.

### LatencyBased

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::LatencyBased)?;
```

After each request completes, the observed wall-clock latency is folded into a per-deployment exponential moving average:

```text
EMA_new = 0.3 * sample + 0.7 * EMA_prev
```

The first sample for a deployment seeds the EMA directly. The deployment with the lowest EMA is selected on the next call. Deployments with no data have EMA 0.0 and are selected first (optimistic default).

### CostBased

```rust
let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::CostBased)?;
```

Attempts deployments in order. On a successful response, logs the estimated USD cost at `TRACE` level. Advances on transient errors. Pricing data comes from the embedded registry at `crates/liter-llm/schemas/catalog.json`.

### WeightedRandom

```rust
let router = Router::new(
    deployments,
    RoutingStrategy::WeightedRandom {
        weights: vec![3.0, 2.0, 1.0],
    },
)?;
```

The `weights` vec must have the same length as `deployments` and the total must be positive. Weight 3.0 means a deployment receives roughly three times as much traffic as one with weight 1.0.

`Router::new` returns `LiterLlmError::BadRequest` if the weights length does not match deployments or if all weights are zero.

### Semantic

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use liter_llm::tower::{
    KeywordClassifier, LlmService, RouteClassifier, Router, RoutingStrategy,
};
use regex::Regex;

let classifier = KeywordClassifier::new(vec![
    (Regex::new(r"(?i)sql|database")?, "gpt-4o".into()),
    (Regex::new(r"(?i)poem|haiku")?, "claude-3-5-sonnet".into()),
]);

let router = Router::new(deployments, RoutingStrategy::Semantic(Arc::new(classifier)))?
    // Deployments are addressed by real model ID, not positional index —
    // this call is required for `Semantic` to route anywhere at all.
    .with_deployment_models(vec!["gpt-4o".into(), "claude-3-5-sonnet".into()]);
```

`RoutingStrategy::Semantic` wraps a [`RouteClassifier`](/usage/observability/) cascade — built-ins are `KeywordClassifier` (regex rules), `EmbeddingSimilarityClassifier` (cosine similarity against precomputed intent-prototype embeddings), and `LlmClassifier` (delegates to a chat model); compose tiers with `CascadeClassifier`, and wrap any of them in `ClassifierVerdictCache` to memoise verdicts. See `crates/liter-llm/src/tower/route_classify.rs` for the full API.

`Router::with_deployment_models` is not optional for `Semantic`: without it, deployments are addressable only by their stringified positional index (`"0"`, `"1"`, ...), which no classifier built around real model names will ever return, so every verdict is discarded and the router silently falls back to round-robin.

## Composing with other layers

`Router` and `FallbackLayer` compose with the rest of the Tower stack. Budget, rate limit, cooldown, health, and tracing layers all wrap the same `Service<LlmRequest>` interface.

The proxy server wires the layers in this order (outermost to innermost): Tracing, Cost, Cache, Budget, RateLimit, Cooldown, Health, Fallback, Router.

```rust
use liter_llm::tower::{
    CostTrackingLayer, FallbackLayer, LlmService, Router, RoutingStrategy, TracingLayer,
};
use tower::ServiceBuilder;

let primary = Router::new(
    vec![LlmService::new(client_a), LlmService::new(client_b)],
    RoutingStrategy::LatencyBased,
)?;
let backup = LlmService::new(fallback_client);

let service = ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(TracingLayer)
    .layer(CostTrackingLayer)
    .layer(FallbackLayer::new(backup))
    .service(primary);
```

## Proxy configuration

In the proxy server, per-model fallbacks are declared in the `[[models]]` table:

```toml
[[models]]
name = "gpt-4o"
provider_model = "openai/gpt-4o"
fallbacks = ["gpt-4o-azure", "gpt-4-fallback"]

[[models]]
name = "gpt-4o-azure"
provider_model = "azure/gpt-4o"
api_key = "${AZURE_API_KEY}"

[[models]]
name = "gpt-4-fallback"
provider_model = "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
api_key = "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
```

The proxy applies the `Fallback` strategy for `fallbacks` lists. Separately, the `[routing]` table selects the `RoutingStrategy` applied to every multi-deployment `[[models]]` group (a name declared by more than one entry); it has no effect on single-deployment models or on `fallbacks` resolution. Omitting `[routing]` preserves the default: round-robin.

```toml
[routing]
strategy = "semantic"

[routing.classifier]
kind = "keyword"

[[routing.classifier.rules]]
pattern = "(?i)sql|database"
model = "gpt-4o"

[[routing.classifier.rules]]
pattern = "(?i)poem|haiku"
model = "claude-3-5-sonnet"
```

`strategy` is one of `round_robin`, `fallback`, `latency_based`, `cost_based`, `weighted_random`, or `semantic`. An unrecognised value is rejected at config-parse time with an actionable error rather than silently defaulting to round-robin. `weighted_random` additionally requires a `weights` array (one entry per deployment, in `[[models]]` declaration order — a mismatched length is rejected when the router is built). `semantic` requires a `[routing.classifier]` table:

- `kind = "keyword"` takes a `rules` array of `{ pattern, model }`, evaluated in order; the first regex match wins.
- `kind = "embedding"` takes `embedding_model`, optional `api_key` / `base_url` for the embedding call, a `threshold` in `[0, 1]`, and a `prototypes` array of `{ name, model, embedding }`. `embedding` is a **precomputed** vector — call the embedding provider once per example prompt yourself and paste the resulting numbers here; the proxy only embeds the live request prompt, not the prototypes.

An invalid `keyword` regex, or a classifier client that fails to construct, is rejected at proxy startup with a clear error. `[routing]` is global — it applies uniformly to every multi-deployment group, so a `weighted_random` weights array sized for one group's deployment count will fail to build for a group with a different count.
